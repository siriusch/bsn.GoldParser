bsn GoldParser .NET Engine
==========================

What is it?
-----------

The engine can consume EGT (and the older CGT) compiled grammar files produced by [Devin Cook's GOLD Parsing System](http://goldparser.org/). This engine is therefore not a standalone parsing solution.

However, it supports all features of GOLD and has the unique ability to directly create specific AST node instances while parsing instead of just creating a parse tree. The bsn.Goldparser.Sample project contains a full working sample, and there are some CodeProject articles such as [The Whole Shebang: Building Your Own General Purpose Language Interpreter](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/129965/The-Whole-Shebang-Building-your-own-general-purpos) which explain the whole process.
